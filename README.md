This FiveM server script features a highly unique design and ensures that all essential player information is displayed on the screen. It is an excellent HUD for both players and streamers.

In addition to displaying the date and time, player name and surname, player ID, job, and rank, it also includes vital stats such as health, armor, hunger, thirst, stamina, oxygen, and stress levels.

This script is entirely my own design and was developed specifically for use on my own servers.
